# Initial-Naive-User-Search-Results
Seventeen pairs of text queries were chosen for their unique roles in cognitive functioning and social interaction, including consciousness, concentration, language and reading comprehension, emotion, self-awareness and recognition, verbal comprehension, facial recognition, visual perception, semantic processing, memory acquisition, complex thought, procedural memory, sensory memory, short-term memory, and theory of mind. Each query was searched once with the phrase "in children with autism spectrum disorder" and once more with the phrase "in children without autism spectrum disorder" to obtain comparable brain maps between the two groups. These maps are shown in Figures 1-17.
